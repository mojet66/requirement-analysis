# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The purpose of this repository is to document all that i have learnt on Requirement Analysis

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the systematic process of identifying, documenting, validating and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as a foundation for designing, developing and delivering a product that aligns with user needs and business objectives.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Cost and Time Efficiency- It helps to detect error early which minimizes rework.
2. Prevents Scope Creep: It helps to manage stakeholders expectations and project boundaries.
3. Enhances Communiation: It aligns the objectives of developers, testers and stakeholders.
4. Risk Mitigation: identifies ambiguities early, thereby reducing costly mid-projects changes.
