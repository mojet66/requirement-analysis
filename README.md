# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The purpose of this repository is to document all that i have learnt on Requirement Analysis

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the systematic process of identifying, documenting, validating and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as a foundation for designing, developing and delivering a product that aligns with user needs and business objectives.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Cost and Time Efficiency- It helps to detect error early which minimizes rework.
2. Prevents Scope Creep: It helps to manage stakeholders expectations and project boundaries.
3. Enhances Communiation: It aligns the objectives of developers, testers and stakeholders.
4. Risk Mitigation: identifies ambiguities early, thereby reducing costly mid-projects changes. 

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. Requirement Gathering: gathering requirements through interviews, workshops, surveys, and observation
2. Requirement Elicitation: conducting brainstorming session to generate ideas, discussion groups to with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirement   
3. Requirement Documentation: creating clear, structured artifacts like Software Requirement Specification, user storie or used cases
4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling: clarifying ambiguities, reolvigs conflicts, ensuring feasibility and creating models
5. Requirement Validation: confirming the requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuraccy and completeness.

## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirements
They define what the sysytem should do. Examples booking system, property search
### Non-Functional Requirements
They describe how the system should peform. Examples scalability, usability

## Use Case Diagrams
Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases). Benefits of use case diagrams are;
+ Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities
+ Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.
+ Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development team.
